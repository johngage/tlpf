I grew up in a Swiss Alp valley, and attended school and college in Zurich. At age 20 I started my first Tofu factory in Switzerland. 

Sport: I ran from 1983-2003 50 Marathons under 3 hours. Currently I organize sport events in Switzerland: track meets for master athletes and school children.\
Development: Through my contacts with Paul Tergat and Tegla Loroupe I support orphaned children in Africa.

Working with the founder of the World Harmony Run Sri Chinmoy (2004),  the project "Kids to Kids" was founded, which started in Switzerland in 2005, to  sponsor runs for the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation in Kenya.

I now run Sports and Development, in Zurich.  https://www.sportanddev.org/en
