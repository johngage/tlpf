The  Kapenguria Peace Academy teaches orphan, refugee, and local children at a residential campus in Kapenguria, Kenya, the County Seat for West Pokot County.  Founded originally for orphans of the conflicts between tribes in North Kenya, the Academy now provides a safe school for children from conflict areas in East Africa.

Over three hundred students ranging in age from 5 to 15 attend classes.  More than half reside in dormitories at the main campus in Kapenguria.
