As the foundation worked over the years in refugee camps in Kenya to promote peace through sports. Many talented athletes appeared in the camps, but had no options to further their careers.

TLPF had created a Sports Training Center for warriors from tribes that raided each other for cattle, to give them a pathway from raiding to sport.

Tegla Loroupe decided to extend her program to refugee camps,  to provide a path for those who were without a country to participate in the Olympics.

Ambassador Tegla Loroupe therefore decided to speak withÂ Thomas Bach, the President of the International Olympic Committee, about the possibility of creating a refugee team, as a joint initiative with the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, the UNHCR Agency. 

This led to the establishment of a training centre for refugee athletes in Ngong (within the outskirts of Nairobi). Five of the refugee athletes from South Sudan quaified for the Refugee Olympic Team in Rio.
