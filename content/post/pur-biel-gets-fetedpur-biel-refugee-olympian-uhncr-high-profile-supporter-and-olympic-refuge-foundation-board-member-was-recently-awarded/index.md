### The African Leaders 4 Change Awards

African Leaders 4 Change Awards(AL4CA) is a premier annual event in Johannesburg, South Africa that celebrates relentless, passionate, and dedicated Africans in the business, philanthropic, and development spaces. These are ordinary people who are doing extra-ordinary work and committed to reshaping the future of the continent through their innovative and sustainable ventures/projects/institutions in their respective communities/countries.

This is indeed a rare recognition not only to the athlete but equally to all refugees working towards promoting peace and cohesion all over the world. We therefore urge everyone to follow suite and emulate them by supporting unity and peace.
