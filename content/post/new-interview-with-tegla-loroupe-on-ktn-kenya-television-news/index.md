On June 26, 2021, the Kenyan television network KTN, Kenya Television news, broadcast a long interiew with Tegla Loroupe. 

Here it is:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm47VwlNATw&ab_channel=KTNNewsKenya

KTN is owned by the Standard Charter Group, who also publish the Standard newspaper.  This in-depth interview was conducted  by Mary Kilobi with Tegla Loroupe on the program "Wako Wapi" , or "Where Are They?".

Most of the broadcast is in Swahili.  The richness is in the KTN archives of many of Tegla's world-record-setting performances in Berlin, Rotterdam, London and New York.

At some time in the future, we will translate the Swahili into English, for subtitles.
