Conflicts among different communities have been very prevalent in Kenya. These conflicts are caused by various reasons ranging from endemic poverty, economic inequality, and cultural reasons. 

 

However, Sport is a universal language that can be understood by all, It’s intrinsic values such as teamwork, fairness, discipline, respect for the opponent and the rules of the game are understood all over the world thus can be harnessed in advancement of solidarity, social cohesion and peaceful coexistence. These values are core in resolving any conflicts. 

 

Here at the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation we are always seeking for new ways of diversifying the use of sports in peace building. This encourages more people to participate since there are people who cannot run but enjoy a different sport, thus more positive results in peace making. We also emphasize on stakeholder analysis, consultation, and incorporation so as to ensure that all our sporting activities are more accommodative. 

 

We always seek to ensure that there is women and children participation so that the peace message will be assimilated by all the age groups; This is because the women and the children are usually the ones who are worst affected by any form of violence. Therefore, the culture of tolerance and togetherness needs to be cultivated to the young generation early on and this will have a positive impact when they grow up.
