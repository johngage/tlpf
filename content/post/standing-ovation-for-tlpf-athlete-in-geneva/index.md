Tegla Loroupe Peace foundation refugee Olympian **Rose Nathike** has stolen the show in the ongoing UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) **[Social Forum](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Poverty/SForum/Pages/SForum2018.aspx)** at the Palais des Nations.

The young athlete drawn from the Kakuma refugee camp to take up training in the Tegla Loroupe track training camp repeatedly brought the crowd to applause when she narrated her life story. A dramatic story of a life journey which saw her flee violence in her home country,South Sudan to seek refuge in the Kakuma Refugee Camp, before finally landing in the TLPF training camp.

The Social Forum, bannered “USING SPORT AND THE OLYMPIC IDEAL TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ALL AND TO STRENGTHEN UNIVERSAL RESPECT FOR THEM”, brings together Government Representatives, UN Personnel, officials from sports governing bodies, philanthropists, business people, top sports personalities and many others.

The forum presented Rose with the rare opportunity to share a podium with dignitaries such as **Andrew Parsons**, President of the International Paralympic Committee, **Nawal El Moutawakel**, International Olympic Committee Member, **Hassan al-Thawadi**, Secretary General, Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, 2022 World Cup, Qatar, **Vogislav Suc**, President of the Human Rights Council, and **Michelle Bachelet**, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
