      title: '6 Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation 
      <br>
      ## The Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation creates peace initiatives in East African pastoralist conflict areas.

      Since its founding in 2003 by **World Champion Tegla Loroupe**, thousands of athletes have trained and competed in Peace Races held in conflict areas in Kenya, in Uganda, and in other conflict areas.
<hl>
Since 2015, hundreds of refugee athletes from South Sudan, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia and other countries have trained at the [Tegla Loroupe International Olympic Refugee Training Camp in Ngong, Kenya](http://bit.ly/37Y0sc3), just  to the west of Nairobi.

In 2016, Ambassador Tegla Loroupe led the International Refugee Olympic team to Rio, where five of the Ngong Training Camp athletes competed.

In 2021, Ambassador Tegla Loroupe led the International Refugee Olympic team to Tokyo.

Tegla Loroupe describes who we are:  an organization dedicated to athletes who compete for themselves, for their families, for their societies, and for peace, honesty and justice among all peoples.'
